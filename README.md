==============

## Introduction ##

A math library supporting REAL, INTERVAL and VECTOR evaluations of
mathematical expressions.

It is partly inspired by [mathExpr][] for Java.

**Note:** This library is still in an early state, the test coverage is not
perfect, the performance is not optimized and some features are still
unimplemented. Basic REAL and INTERVALevaluations should work though.
Suggestions and pull requests are always welcome!

## Features ##

* Parsing of mathematical expressions.
* Evaluation of expressions in different modes.
* Supporting most functions out of the box.
* Well documented.

## Documentation ##

To follow.

## Examples ##

For now, see [examples.dart](example/examples.dart)
